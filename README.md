Predicting_Credit_Card_Approvals
This is a project which I had done. 
Data from the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval

	Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved.

	Data:  Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

	Handling the missing values: Impute the missing values with mean or the most frequent value.

	Preprocessing the data: use LabelEncoder to non-numeric values to numeric; use MinMaxScaler to rescale.

	Making predictions and evaluating performance: use Logistic Regression with GridSearchCV; confusion_matrix
